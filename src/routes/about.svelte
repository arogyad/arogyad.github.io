	<p>
		<b>Welcome to my blog!</b>
		I write mostly about computer science but sometimes I write about random stuff I do. Most of my stuff
		are quite boring, but you might find something interesting to read (Please let me know if you find
		anything interesting). I like compilers, machine learning among other things. Please contact me at: <a
			href="mailto:arogyadahal20@gmail.com">arogyadahal20@gmail.com</a
		>. The about section is pretty short as I don't have much to say about myself that isn't immensly boring. I will add things to this about as I go on with time. Thank you!
