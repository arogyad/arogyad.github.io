{"content":{"out":{"attributes":{"title":"A newer look of the blog","date":"2021-10-12"},"body":"<p>I haven&#39;t posted in a while, that is partly because of my exams and couple of side projects I have been involved in (I might finish it in couple of weeks and write about it then). In the mean time, I wanted to talk about the modifications in to this blog. The routing is slicker and the code block looks better. Only thing I need to change is the rendering of equations, which I was having a hard time with. I haven&#39;t touched this code for over 3 weeks now as I had exams just a week ago, but now I will be making some changes to the way things look around here + I will be adding some Easter eggs. By the way, this was made using one of the most beautiful framework in the world, <a href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Sveltekit</a> and <a href=\"https://svelte.dev\" target=\"_blank\">Svelte</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-are-the-changes\">What are the changes?!</h1>\n<p>I love the old hyde poole theme, but some of the parts weren&#39;t very good looking, so I made a couple of changes. The <a href=\"/about\">About Section</a> has changed a bit, the <a href=\"/blogs\"> Blogs Section</a> has changed quite a lot and there is a dark mode development going on. The padding and margins have changed as well but the responsiveness is the same as before.</p>\n<p>The code section has changed as well. It is <a href=\"https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox\" target=\"_blank\">gruvbox light theme</a>, and yes I love light theme more than dark theme. The most important thing that has changed is the routing system, which is all thanks to svelte.</p>\n<h1 id=\"working-with-svelte--tailwind\">Working with Svelte &amp; Tailwind</h1>\n<p>Svelte is the god amongst men when it comes to web dev. This view is coming from a person who has 0 experience with frontend experience other than a dangerously little knowledge about javascript. The workflow is extremely smooth and the final product is better than the development process, which is saying a lot as the development process with svelte was extraordinarily beautiful.</p>\n<p>Along with svelte, <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">tailwindcss</a> also helped me create this website such quickly. The bunch of predefined classes with tailwind makes the whole css game go much enjoyable. I don&#39;t have to write anything, just mix and match the classes and there comes the result. All and all, these two things are enough for most of my webdev requirements.</p>\n<h1 id=\"things-to-be-done\">Things to be done</h1>\n<p>There are couple of things that needs to be done. I am planning to add a dark mode to the website, there is a hidden easter egg that adds a minimal dark mode to the website. <del>The most important thing right now is to fix the maths rendering. My search for a better solution is on, and I hope I find it.</del> [Edit: I found a way to add mathematics thanks to a discussion github: <a href=\"https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1538#issuecomment-703283129\">https://github.com/markedjs/marked/issues/1538#issuecomment-703283129</a>.
