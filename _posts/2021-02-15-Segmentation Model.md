title: 'Cuda out of memory' is cool and all but have you ever tried frying your CPU!

While there are many things that one can worry about, the thing that gets me the most worried is not knowing if today is the last day my laptop will have a working CPU. I feel so bad for my CPU, it has gone through so much i.e from me trying to play triple A titles to making it render a video in the highest possible quality even though my screen cannot even display one third of that resolution. My CPU is pretty cool, it does like to work but I feel like I have given it so much negative reward that it has now developed an algorithm by itself which tries to minimize this work load while trying to give optimal performance. You might be wondering why I am talking about these stuffs, or why I tried rendering that video, well couple of weeks ago I almost fried my CPU, okay I am exaggerating a little ( alot maybe) but it was a little worrying not gonna lie.

So couple of weeks ago I was looking at this image segmentation model, it has a cool name, <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326v3.pdf' target='_blank'>Tiramisu</a>. It is so really huge (just look at <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337761543/figure/fig1/AS:832731072180225@1575549967716/FC-DenseNet-architecture.ppm' target='_blank'>this</a> monstrosity), it has more than 100 layers (100 may not seem like a huge number but for me it's a really big number), and I tried making this model, it might look intimidating but it's like a series. Most of the time I don't know what I am doing but this one it was good one reason for this was because the paper is really helpful with everything.
