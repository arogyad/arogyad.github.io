These will be a  series of blogs talking about my experience while learning ***RUST*** and making sure that I understand what I am studying. These will be like a revision of stuffs that I learned, or a reference that I am writing to myself, something that I can come back to when I have forgotten some concept and need a quick refresher. Writing while studying helps me to understand thinks more better so I am trying to write these blogs. These blogs may contain a lot of mistakes and I apologize for that. Please let me know if you find anything wrong.

# Why Rust?

***Rust***, I love it. Eventhough I haven't spent much time with it (about 2 weeks), I feel like the language is a great mixture of strictness and flexibility.  The type system of Rust is something that I find truly amazing. Rust seems so much safer, resource acquisition seems so much cleaner as compared to other lower level languages, and **stricter**.
